CPAN-Testers-WWW-Reports-Parser
===============================

This distribution is the CPAN Testers reports data parser.

This distribution is used to extract the data from either a JSON or a YAML file
containing metadata regarding reports submitted by CPAN Testers, and available 
from the CPAN Testers website.

DEPENDENCIES

The scripts require the following Perl modules to be installed:

  Carp

Requires one of the following, depending which type of parsing is required:

  JSON::XS
  YAML::XS

INSTALLATION

To install this module, untar the tarball into the directory of choice then
type the following on the command line (substitute make with nmake or dmake
if appropriate):

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

Alternatively you may wish to use the CPAN.pm shell or CPANPLUS shell as your
installer, which will automatically detect uninstalled prerequisities and 
install those too for you.

CPAN TESTERS FUND

CPAN Testers wouldn't exist without the help and support of the Perl 
community. However, since 2008 CPAN Testers has grown far beyond the 
expectations of it's original creators. As a consequence it now requires
considerable funding to help support the infrastructure.

In early 2012 the Enlightened Perl Organisation very kindly set-up a
CPAN Testers Fund within their donatation structure, to help the project
cover the costs of servers and services.

If you would like to donate to the CPAN Testers Fund, please follow the link
below to the Enlightened Perl Organisation's donation site.

If your company would like to support us, you can donate financially via the
fund link above, or if you have servers or services that we might use, please
send an email to admin@cpantesters.org with details.

Our full list of current sponsors can be found at our I <3 CPAN Testers site.
